### Denki
Hi Guys

I had a chat with MS about the Reflex game and bringing you guys on board and I didn't get a hugely positive response. It's nothing to do with Denki but more Nick is keen to carry on with the team they had before. I've spelt it out that those guys can act as a great bank of experience to draw on regarding what's works both technically and from a game play standpoint with Kinect but they're on Halo / Paradox for the foreseeable with extensions to both projects completely possible.

They're mulling it over and I'll get a chance to press a bit more on that front next week.

The UI work for Halo has grown in size but they've also signed it to United Front now, so that's out of the picture.

We are still looking to staff on Halo and Breach but again bothj p


## Breach Hit List
Just want to make sure I've got everything for Breach

* I'll make it clear I'm just looking for single word yay or nay for the list of coders - not a load of recruitment work
* I'll reach out to Andy Campbell about the possibility of doing recruitment work for us
* I'll see if Guy's UI mate is available for doing the UI work
    * Can do this is in principle but if a possibility it'll move onto how much work, when for and how much
* We'll contract Ross just for the next milestone as a starter - Need to get a quote from him though
* I've two irons in the fire on the coder front
    * Rob Brooks - http://uk.linkedin.com/pub/rob-brooks/0/b10/32a
    * Dean Calver - http://uk.linkedin.com/in/deanoc
* Billy nudge baz on Gareth / Neil McN
* I'll see if I can rope in Martin to help work on this list of 30 unity coders
* Billy rope in Martin to scour pinterest for potential concept guys

Anything else?

Assuming that they all know there's definitely an infection if one monk had it, went into lunch and saw no other blue dots he'd know he had it and would die on day 2

If 2 had it they'd see each other and both think "he'll be dead tomorrow" When neither are dead they'd both twig they both had and it die on day 3
if 3 had it they'd all look at the other 2 and work out they'll be dead in a couple of days. That doesn't happen all 3 know they have it and all die on day 4
So on the morning of day 14 13 would be dead?
